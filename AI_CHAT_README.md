# AI Chat System Documentation

## Overview

A comprehensive AI Chat system has been integrated into your Laravel application. The chat widget appears as a floating button on all pages and provides contextual assistance to users.

## Features

### 🎯 **Smart Contextual Responses**

-   Authentication-aware responses (different for logged-in vs guest users)
-   Context-specific help for posts, profiles, following, categories, etc.
-   Pattern matching for natural conversation flow

### 🎨 **Modern UI/UX**

-   Floating chat bubble in bottom-right corner
-   Smooth animations and transitions
-   Mobile-responsive design
-   Accessibility features (focus states, reduced motion support)
-   Dark mode support
-   Custom scrollbars and typing indicators

### 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

-   **Controller**: `AiChatController` - Handles chat requests
-   **Service**: `AiChatService` - Contains AI logic and response generation
-   **Component**: `ai-chat.blade.php` - Frontend chat widget
-   **Styling**: `ai-chat.css` - Custom CSS for enhanced UX

## API Endpoints

    "success": true,
    "message": "📝 **Post Management Help**:\n\n• **Create Post**: Click the 'Create Post' button...",

### Adding New Response Patterns

Edit `app/Services/AiChatService.php` and add new patterns in the `generateResponse()` method:

```php
if ($this->matchesPattern($lowerMessage, ['your', 'keywords'])) {
    return $this->getYourCustomResponse($isAuthenticated);
}
```

### Styling Modifications

Update `resources/css/ai-chat.css` to modify:
