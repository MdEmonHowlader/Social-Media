2. **Admin Middleware**: `EnsureUserIsAdmin` middleware protects admin routes
3. **User Model Methods**: `isAdmin()` and related role management methods
4. **Admin Promotion**: Use artisan command or contact form method

### Manual Integration (if needed):

1. **Include in layouts**:

```blade
@include('components.ai-chat')
```

2. **Add CSS**:

```blade
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset('css/ai-chat.css') }}">
```

3. **Ensure CSRF token**:

```blade
<meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}">
```

4. **HTTPS Requirement**:

```nginx
# Ensure HTTPS for voice features
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    # SSL configuration...
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

2. **Messages not sending**: Verify CSRF token and route configuration
3. **Styling issues**: Ensure CSS file is properly loaded
4. **Mobile responsiveness**: Check viewport meta tag
5. **Admin features not showing**: Verify user has admin role and proper authentication

### Voice-Specific Issues:

1. **Microphone not working**: Check browser permissions and HTTPS requirement
2. **Speech not playing**: Verify browser audio settings and speech toggle
3. **Poor recognition**: Check microphone quality and background noise
4. **Browser compatibility**: Ensure browser supports Web Speech API
5. **Permission denied**: Guide user through microphone permission setup

### Admin-Specific Issues:

1. **Admin responses not working**: Check `isAdmin()` method in User model
2. **Role detection failing**: Verify middleware and authentication
3. **Admin routes not accessible**: Check admin middleware configuration

### Debug Mode:

Enable JavaScript console logging by uncommenting debug lines in the chat component for development troubleshooting.
