    return $this->getYourCustomResponse($isAuthenticated);
}

// Add corresponding response method

## Installation & Setup

The AI Chat system is **automatically available** on all pages for all user types. The system is fully integrated with:

-   **Laravel Blade layouts** (app.blade.php and guest.blade.php)
-   **CSRF token handling** for secure form submissions
-   **Authentication system** for personalized responses
-   **Role-based system** for admin capabilities
-   **Responsive design** working across all device types

### Role System Setup:

1. **Admin Role Creation**: Use migration to add role column to users table
2. **Admin Middleware**: `EnsureUserIsAdmin` middleware protects admin routes
3. **User Model Methods**: `isAdmin()` and related role management methods
4. **Admin Promotion**: Use artisan command or contact form method

### Manual Integration (if needed):

1. **Include in layouts**:

```blade
@include('components.ai-chat')
```

2. **Add CSS**:

```blade
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset('css/ai-chat.css') }}">
```

3. **Ensure CSRF token**:

```blade
<meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}">
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Chat not appearing**: Check if component is included in layout
2. **Messages not sending**: Verify CSRF token and route configuration
3. **Styling issues**: Ensure CSS file is properly loaded
4. **Mobile responsiveness**: Check viewport meta tag
5. **Admin features not showing**: Verify user has admin role and proper authentication

### Admin-Specific Issues:

1. **Admin responses not working**: Check `isAdmin()` method in User model
2. **Role detection failing**: Verify middleware and authentication
3. **Admin routes not accessible**: Check admin middleware configuration

### Debug Mode:

Enable JavaScript console logging by uncommenting debug lines in the chat component for development troubleshooting.
